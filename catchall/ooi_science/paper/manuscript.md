- An Executable Ocean: Data Democratization for the Ocean Observatories Initiative   
- The Ocean Observatories Initiative Science Ready Room  


### Abstract
This paper presents a series of scientific investigations and datasets in the form of executable cloud-hosted jupyter notebooks. We explore new possibilities in improving ease of use for the community by building tools that accelerate research on the Ocean Observatories Initiative dataset. The methods described in this paper provide a reproducible and flexible framework for getting information from “sensors to publications”. Notebooks are organized by oceanographic science topic, instead of OOI cyberinfrastructure system terminology. Our aim is to prime reseachers with methods and data poised for publication.
