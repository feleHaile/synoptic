# Robs notebooks

These folders and notebooks are intended for Port Cormorack (a JupyterHub for the Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) 
with some broader applicability to geoscience. This content is also highly relevant for advanced outreach. Everything
here is intended to demonstrate data access and visualization across a wide variety of resources. Pull requests welcome.


**Note: The 'kilroy' folder is for custom code used by multiple notebooks.**
