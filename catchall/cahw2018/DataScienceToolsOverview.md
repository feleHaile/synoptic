### Data Science Tools

------------------
#### Jupyter notebooks

* We have a Jupyter Hub!
	- access to Python 3 Jupyter Notebooks on the cloud
	- each person gets 4 cpu's, 8gb mem allocated.
	- notebooks stay (unless the hub crashes/terminated)
	- best to push to your github from the terminal
	
* Quick Jupyter Notebook navigation
	- Calculations in code cells
	- Explanations in markdown cells

short cuts: shift enter, cell above, cell below, delete cells

What notebooks are good for:

	* data exploration
	* writing math
	* report
	* tutorials
	* sharing on the web, with collaborators
	* running code interactively on a remote machine


What notebooks are not good for:

	* for storing functions and libraries
	* anything, when they get long and messy
	* for version control

Extra resources: on the [wiki](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/cabled_array_hw2018/wiki/Resources).

* how to run notebooks locally: `jupyter notebook`
* useful editors/ides: Atom, Spyder, Jupyter Lab, ...

#### Git topics to cover:

* overview & examples

	[https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice)
	
   [https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice)
* understand staging, committing
* pushing, pulling remote repo
* history
* merge conflict

[Collaboration workflows:](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)

* all members push directly to a repo
* fork workflow + Pull Request
* branch workflow + Pull Request
* dev branch workflow

gotchas:
detached mode,
pullin empty repo, readme
different action: file vs folder
