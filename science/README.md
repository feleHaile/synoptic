# Introduction  

This folder features a collection of topic-oriented notebooks from Ocean Observatories Initiative community work. 
This is presented here as a resource 'over and above' the core **synoptic** content: 
{ **RCO**, **MODIS**, **ARGO**, **GLODAP**, **CMR** }. 
The notebooks here are organized by scientific topic rather than OOI system terminology.
Each topic folder has a main notebook showing the data visualization, along with a data folder that hosts or retrieves the data from the system. In the case of high density datasets (like BOTPT) data are downsampled and hosted inside the folder, so that the visualization runs smoothly on even a minimal cloud-hosted platform. 

## Topics

* Executable Ocean is a set of ideas for a manuscript
