### A collection of Python Jupyter notebooks intended as an ocean data science tutorial

The **robfatland** GitHub user **synoptic** repository contains ocean data science Jupyter notebeooks 
oriented towards intercomparison of different empirical data resources: glodap, argo, NASA satellites, etcetera. 
The central data resource is the Regional Cabled Observatory (abbreviated RCO) located in the northeast Pacific. 
The material herein is also intended as a tutorial in both the basics of Python data charting and in the deconstruction
of NetCDF data files into comprehensible components. 


It is important to note that not all Python environments are equivalent. These notebooks were developed on a Jupyter Hub
built and maintained at the University of Washington in 2018. Called 'PortCormorack' this Python environment has many
key packages pre-installed to facilitate the task of *getting to the data*, our primary concern. To obtain access to
the Port Cormorack Jupyter Hub please contact us using the email address *pangeo at uw dot edu*. 

## High-level summary

All notebooks are from the [robfatland/synoptic](https://github.com/robfatland/synoptic) repository unless noted.


* glodap
  * [Global Ocean Data Analysis Project](https://www.glodap.info/), a static snapshot of the state of the ocean oriented towards carbon
* argo
  * The [ARGO drifter program](http://argo.ucsd.edu/) provides *in situ* comparative data
* rco
  * Data from the [Regional Cabled Observatory (RCO)](http://app-dev.ooica.net/)
* visions
  * From [VISIONS](https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/) the data from CTD casts: RCO summer support cruises
* [cmr (separate repository)](https://github.com/pangeo-data/cmr)
  * Data from NASA remote sensing platforms including sea surface temperature and mean sea level anomaly
* hydrophone
  * Data from the RCO that is not part of the CI/UFrame program; includes charismatic megafauna signals
